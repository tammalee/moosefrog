__Damian:__ I fail to see the point of this exercise, Grayson.

__Dick:__ It's Halloween, little D! Time to put on a costume, scare people and get candy!

__Damian:__ *looks down at his Robin costume*

__Damian:__ *thinks about the last group of bad guys who screamed when they realized it was Robin, and not Batman, who was apprehending them*

__Damian:__ Hm. Gimme candy.

__Dick:__ Ha ha, it's not that eaâ€”

__Damian:__ *hood goes up, evil smile is seen, a sword is drawn*

__Damian:__ Gimme candy. NOW.

__Dick:__ ...if you do that on Patrol, Bruce is gonna kill me.

One. Month. Later.

__Jason:__ Hey Demonspawn, where'd you get the candy?

__Damian:__ *lollipop in his mouth, a large sack of candy in his lap*

__Damian:__ It's Halloween.

__Jason:__ Yeah, like, last month... Halloween's over.

__Damian:__ *shrugs* I wear a costume. I scare people. I get candy. I can do Halloween on any day of the year.

__Jason:__ ...

__Jason:__ *whispers* Holy shit. I could be getting candy...
