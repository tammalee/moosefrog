__Damian:__ What? Are you wearing?

__Steph:__ A costume!

__Damian:__ You're not going out on patrol with me like that.

__Steph:__ You're not my supervisor! :D

__Damian:__ Father!

__Bruce:__ If she wants to wear a sheet with two holes cut out of it over her regular costume, that's on her.

__Damian:__ Ugh.

__Steph:__ It's my Robin #2 costume! :D

__Bruce:__ Wow. You come into my caveâ€”

__Steph:__ Jay gave me permission!

__Bruce:__ -_- Of course he did.
