__Jason:__ Steal his keys!

__Damian:__ Haha! Then honk until he gets confused!

__Tim:__ No! I'm putting his keys in the pond! Ha! No more keys for joo!

__Damian:__ HAHA YES! YES! No more keys for you, oppressive gardener!

__Jason:__ Gimme a turn, Nerd boy!

__Tim:__ Nuh-uh, you know the rule! I play until I die then someone else gets to play!

__Damian:__ Yes, Todd, that is the rule we all agreed to.

__Jason:__ *mutter grumble mutter*

__Dick:__ Oh, hey! You guys are playing that Untitled Goose Game? Man, it's so refreshing to see a video game without violence or death in it for a change!

__Damian:__ *looks at Jason*

__Jason:__ *looks at Damian*

__Damian:__ So, you play until YOU die, Drake?

__Jason:__ *rolling up his sleeves* Just wanna make sure we're clear on the rules...

__Tim:__ Um, honk?
