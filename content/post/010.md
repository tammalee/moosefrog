__Damian:__ So... Drake, is it?

__Tim:__ Yes. And I'm keeping it. Fuck the haters.

__Damian:__ I can respect that sentiment.

__Tim:__ Thanks.

__Damian:__ Did you know ducks are an excellent example of a species with intense sexual competition doing strange things to genitalia? Male ducks have penises that can reach three feet in length. I saw a picture of a duck with this twisted, knotted length of venous tissue dangling behind it and thought it was his intestines so remarkable is the resemblance. Here, I saved a picture of it on my phone.

__Tim:__ ...I'm changing my name.

__Damian:__ Oh. Are you certain?

__Tim:__ *gritted teeth* Yes.

__Damian:__ Pity. It suited you.

__Tim:__ I hate you times a thousand.

__Damian:__ Shocking. If you'll excuse me, I have just heard some news that I think will cheer Grayson up immensely.

__Tim:__ You! Pfft! Was this—? You—!!

__Damian:__ Good-bye, Drake.

__Tim:__ ...times a MILLION!
