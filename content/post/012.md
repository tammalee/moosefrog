__Damian:__ What do you mean you, "have the same teacher as last year"? I thought you had graduated?

__Jon:__ Yeah, well, I guess Mrs. Johnson is teaching high school now. *sigh* She hates me.

__Damian:__ *has the strangest look on his face*

__Jon:__ Damian?

__Damian:__ It's nothing. So, tell me about your classes...

[ Later ]

__Damian:__ Hey, Todd. When boring regular American children graduate do they, or do they not, ritualistically shoot their teacher in the head and display the corpse in a corpse garden upon which they may gaze and appreciate the sacrifices that had been made to make them great?

__Jason:__ Uh, not? Yeah. Not. Definitely not.

__Damian:__ Right. I knew that.

__Jason:__ *long, slow suck on his beer bottle*

__Jason:__ *not looking away*

__Jason:__ Uh huh. Sure you did.
