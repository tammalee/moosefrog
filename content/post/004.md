__Damian:__ Drake, this is the third week in a row you have selected The Emperor's New Groove as the movie night feature.

__Tim:__ AND YET the primary lesson in this movie HAS YET TO BE ABSORBED!

__Dick:__ Tim...

__Damian:__ Tt. The LESSON is very simple; do not entrust servants with important tasks. Duh. I had learned that lesson when I was three.

__Jason:__ Dick! DICK! HELP ME RESTRAIN TIM! HE'S STRONGER THAN HE LOOKS!
