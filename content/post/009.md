__Damian:__ Good morning, Grayson.

__Damian:__ Drake.

__Tim:__ SERIOUSLY? I SHOULD'VE KNOWN YOU'D ATTACK MY NEW NAME LIKE THAT DAMIAN! AUGH! EVERYONE IS GIVING ME SUCH A HARD TIME! I THOUGHT I'D BE SAFE HERE FOR A FEW DAYS BUT NOOOOO *storms out of the kitchen*

__Dick:__ *head in hands* Noooooo... he was finally calm.

__Damian:__ *blink blink* Since when is 'Drake' a new name?

__Jason:__ *walks into the kitchen loading a tranq gun*

__Jason:__ Shhhh. Be vewwy vewwy quiet. I'm hunting ducks...

__Dick:__ *weary voice* Shouldn't that be, 'wabbits'?

__Jason:__ It's duck season! :D

__Dick:__ Of course it is... -_-

__Damian:__ I'm going back to bed. Wake me up when this insanity is over.
