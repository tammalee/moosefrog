__Dick:__ Uh-ohhhh, I think our little brother has a major crush on someone!

__Jason:__ Mm? Is she hot?

__Dick:__ I think you mean, is HE hot? Look at Damian's sketchbook.

__Jason flips through:__ Tall, dark, and handsome.. hm..

__Tim:__ That's John Wick.

__Dick:__ Oh! You know him?

__Jason:__ Who?

__Tim:__ *sighs* He's a character from a movie. He's an assassin who goes on a killing spree when someone murders his puppy.

__Dick:__ I.. what?

__Jason:__ Figures. *turns the sketchbook sideways, still looking*

__Tim:__ *sips coffee*

__Tim:__ John Wick's hot as hell, tho. I'd let him do me.

__Jason:__ Same.

__Dick:__ Guys! Seriously!

__Dick:__ ...same.

_Hours later...._

__Damian:__ Why does it look like my sketchbook has been passed around like a harlot at a brothel?
