I’m reading some canon Bat-comics and…

..holy fucking shit on a stick!

Did Talia SERIOUSLY replace every single organ in 10-year-old Damian’s body after he was in an explosion? Like, WITH NO MEDICAL EXAM FIRST?

Just straight up, yo, my boy’s doing good so like, let’s take him to the next level. Naw, don’t bother fixing any of those damaged organs, let’s just yank ‘em all out and put new ones in. You got any of them spinner spleens? Ohhh yeahhh that’ll be so sick! Bruce is totally gonna wanna stick his dick in me when he sees how awesome I’ve made our son!

Now all I can picture is Damian actually getting a really for real driver’s license and seeing the organ donor thing on the back and going, “Well, OBVIOUSLY I’ll donate my used organs. Are there actually people out there who have the internal organs they were born with at my age? Hahaha, freaks.“

And whomever he is with is like, “Uhh… what?“
