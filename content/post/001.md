Do you think the rest of the Batfam uses 'Bruce' as more than a name?

"You really 'Bruced' that one up, Dick."

"Did you see that hit? He took it like a 'Bruce'!"

"Ugh. Fine. I guess I better go maximum-'Bruce' for this party."

"I'm worried, Master Dick. Master Damian has been 'Brucing' in his room for three days."

"I cannot sleep yet. Mix me up some 'Bruce'-juice, Pennyworth!"

"New suit, Damian? You're looking all 'Bruced' up!"

"Hey, uh, so do you mind if I crash here for a few nights? I pulled a 'Bruce' on Kori and she kicked me out."
