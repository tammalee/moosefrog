G*d help the Bat-family when Damian Wayne discovers ABBA… and loves it.

OH gawd. I can’t get the image of Bat!Dick and Robin!Damian prepping for a night of patrol to ABBA. Dick would be dancing. Damian would be disparaging.

Until one evening, Dick catches Damian mouthing the words to Waterloo under his breath.

Dick can’t stop smiling ALL NIGHT and it irritates the heck out of Damian who will insist the song is terrible because of its historical inaccuracy.

AUGH!

Damian AND Dick start integrating quotes from ABBA songs into their everyday speech.

Alfred just rolls his eyes because he was there for the pre-patrol ABBA sessions but it flies under the radar for the other people in they interact with.

Until Jason Todd rolls back into their lives.

Damian *dramatically*: Memories, good days, bad days, they’ll be with me always.

Jason: o_O Did the demon brat seriously just quote ABBA?

Tim: Mmm, what? Who? *Has no idea as that’s not his type of music.*

Dick *from where he’s pulling on his suit*: In these old familiar rooms…

Jason: Wait, now it makes sense… 9_9
