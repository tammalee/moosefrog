__Jason:__ Hey small-fry, what're you eating?

__Damian:__ *Using a knife and fork* Burger.

__Jason:__ I thought you were vegetarian cuz of your pet cow?

__Damian:__ I am. This is a 'beyond meat' burger.

__Jason:__ 'Beyond meat'? Like, human flesh made in a laboratory soylent green-type meat?

__Damian:__ ...

__Jason:__ Here, if you're grossed out, I'll just finish that burger for you...

__Damian:__ *smacks Jay's knuckles with the back of his fork*

__Damian:__ The knowledge I was consuming laboratory-grown human flesh wouldn't put me off finishing my burger, Todd.

__Jason:__ Damn. You're hardc0re for a tiny little cow-hugger.

__Damian:__ Go get your own.

__Jason:__ Share fries?

__Damian:__ *pushes one tiny fry off of his plate onto the table*

__Jason:__ Yes! Victory is mine!

__Damian:__ *pushes fry onto the floor*

__Jason:__ You know, you're kind of an asshole.

__Damian:__ And...?

__Jason:__ *sniffles* I'm so proud!
