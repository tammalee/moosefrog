__Dick:__ Tim! You brought your bags! Are you staying at the Manor? Here, let me help you with that it looks heavy!

__Damian:__ ...

__Tim:__ Meh. I sorta got shot up and Alfred said he'll worry himself into an early grave if I'm not here where he can keep an eye on me.

__Dick:__ Haha! That sounds like Alfred, alright.

__Damian:__ ...

__Tim:__ And I heard Damian has laryngitis so it's a great time to visit!

__Dick:__ You heard correctly. The poor thing hasn't been able to say a word since yesterday morning.

__Damian:__ ...!

__Tim:__ I thought it seemed more welcoming around here.

__Dick:__ Between Alfred and I we've managed to confiscate all of his swords!

__Damian:__ *knocks a vase off of a shelf so it shatters loudly*

__Tim:__ ...do I squirt him with water when he does that?

__Dick:__ Haha! *mutters* I dare you to.

__Damian:__ *bends down and picks up a wicked sharp-looking piece of shattered vase* ...

__Tim:__ You know what? I can get a hotel.

__Dick:__ Drop it! Drop it this instant, young man!

__Damian:__ ...

__Damian:__ *turns and runs up the stairs with the piece of vase*

__Tim:__ How about you just give me my bag back, Diâ€”

__Dick:__ OH NO YOU DON'T! *takes off after Damian still holding Tim's bag*

__Tim:__ Nnnnnooooooooo... that bag has my laptop in it...

__Tim:__ Guess I'm staying here. ;_;
